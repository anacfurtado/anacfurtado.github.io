	<p>So... Today was just like any other day. I went to school, sat through my classes, then went to my tennis class and then home. Nothing special, a day like any other. 
	<br><br>
	NO! Ok, these things did happen but when I got home is when my day was started to get interesting... 
	<br><br>
	I was scrolling trough my Instagram explore when I found a picture of a girl that looks like me. At first, I thought it was me but I would've recognized what the girl was wearing or where the picture was taken. However, I didn't.
	<br><br>
	So, I commented on her picture:
