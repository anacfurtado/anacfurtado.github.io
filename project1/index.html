		<p>Dinner is served!</p>
		<p>Never mind. I can hold it.</p>
		<p>Bon appetit!</p>

		<p>Let’s not sit here with our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in.</p>
		<p>Don’t mind if I do, Lillian.</p>
		<p>I suppose any grandchildren I could expect from you would be...</p>
		<p>Ogres, yes!</p>
		<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Right, Harold?</p>
		<p>Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is, assuming you don’t eat your own young!</p>
		<p>Dad!</p>

		<p>Shrek, please!</p>
		<p>I only did that because I love her.</p>
		<p>Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle.</p>
